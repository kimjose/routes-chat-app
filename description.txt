create a landing page for an application that connects drivers with other people sharing the same route.
The driver posts a trip and the route to be used. Other interested parties will see the trip and request to join.
The driver who posted the trip can accept or reject the request to join.
When the request is accepted the app links the driver with the client.
This app can be useful for users commuting to work using their personal cars. With this they can ride along and still get to work 
at a cost that is lower.
This also helps the driver matters cost as those riding along will be paying some amount.
As result it minimizes traffic and air pollution.
